	* BUGFIX (configure.in): Changed XPMDIR from xpm to xpm/lib.

	* BUGFIX (configure.in): From Mike Roda <mroda@ipass.net>, I
 	scavenged some code for the configure.in script so that it will
 	correctly find the X libraries and X includes on linux [this will
 	probably work on other OSes as well].  I also found the reason I
 	was getting errors when running the configure script: configure.in
 	was using parentheses in a few places where it should have been
 	using curly braces.  Lastly, I changed configure.in to force the
 	makefile to use the libz.a in the zlib subdirectory, otherwise the
 	compiler kept trying to use the libz.a I had in /usr/lib which
 	wasn't compatible.  So anyway, I fixed up configure.in, ran
 	autoconf, and now the whole thing builds "out-of-the-box" on my
 	system.

	* BUGFIX (shortcomm.c): thetorp->t_fuse was being set to INTMAX,
