2000-03-23	Dave Ahn <ahn@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	* Added UDP_PORTSWAP code back in, enabled by default.
	
	* Added SP2 support.  Needs testing.

2000-03-22	Bob Glamm <glamm@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Changed all instances of ted, tedturner, Ted, and Ted Turner,
	to something involving Paradise.

	* Made all XBM images compiled in by default as something for the
	client to fall back on.  Also made rainbow dashboard XPM and
	MOTD header XPM compiled in by default (it was easier than
	modifying the code to handle those two cases).

	* Made useExternalImages on by default.  This way an external
	image always overrides an internal image (either XBM or XPM).

	* Fixed up handling for external images if they did not exist.

	* Added context-sensitive ship images.  If the complete set
	of images exists:

	  1) on a P-server, the <team> and <team>.colored pixmaps are used;
	     on a B-server, the <team>.bronco & <team>.bronco.colored pixmaps
	     are used.
	  2) Friendly players use the normal (grey) pixmaps; non-friendly
	     players use the colored pixmaps.

	This way we get easy distinction between server types, AND we
	get easy distinction between who's friendly and who's not.

2000-03-20	Bob Glamm <glamm@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added multipath support to shipBitmapPath, changed default
	path.  shipBitmapPath is now a colon-separated list of paths
	that specifies where to find the XBM or XPM images.  By default
	it is "~/.tedturner/images:${datadir}/paradise/images".  The image
	that is loaded is the first one found, so this default image path
	also allows a user to override system-installed images by plopping
	them down in their home directories.

	* Fixed up ship XPMs.  Consistent colors and single-
	view SBs are now present for all races.

2000-03-17	Bob Glamm <glamm@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Fixed problem with locking on cloaked players from Bronco
	observer mode.

	* Fixed up some Ind and weapon XBMs.

2000-03-15	Bob Glamm <glamm@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added 'make install' target and addition of default images path
	in client.

	* dynamic_images is now the only supported build method.

	* General preparation for first client release.
	
2000-03-03	Dave Ahn <ahn@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	* BUGFIX: 36 player support for the Netrek Vanilla Server.
	
2000-01-13	Dave Ahn <ahn@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	* BUGFIX (x11window.c): Jeffrey Watts <watts@jayhawks.net>
 	submitted a patch to get TT to work under Window Make in Linux.
	
  	"I've noticed that TedTurner has certain problems when used with
 	Window Maker.  Specifically, the metaserver window fails to appear
 	when "-m" is passed to 'TedTurner'.  I tracked the problem down to
 	the way in which Window Maker handles the "WithdrawnState" hint
 	that TedTurner passes to WindowMaker."
	
	"I'm a complete novice when it comes to X, but as far as I can
 	gather, our windows shouldn't be passing "WithdrawnState".
  	Instead, they probably should be passing "NormalState".  This
 	problem manifests itself with Window Maker since WM uses
 	"WithdrawnState" to mean an application that runs in its icon
 	(dock application)."
	
	"I've made a patch against "x11window.c" that corrects this
 	problem.  This patch also comments out "char *strdup();", which
 	was causing compilation to fail on my Linux system (Red Hat
 	6.1/x86 - all errata applied)."
	
2000-01-06	Dave Ahn <ahn@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	* VERSION: 1.3.1.1-export
	
	* RELEASE: 1.3.1.1-export is an interim CVS tag to facilitate
 	migration to sourceforge.net.  If you are interested in
 	contributing to Paradise client and/or server development, please
 	visit http://www.sourceforge.net and create an account there.  You
 	can then email me with your Source Forge account name or UID, and
 	I can add you to the project.

1999-01-28	Dave Ahn <ahn@vec.wfubmc.edu>

	* BUGFIX (configure.in): Changed XPMDIR from xpm to xpm/lib.

	* BUGFIX (configure.in): From Mike Roda <mroda@ipass.net>, I
 	scavenged some code for the configure.in script so that it will
 	correctly find the X libraries and X includes on linux [this will
 	probably work on other OSes as well].  I also found the reason I
 	was getting errors when running the configure script: configure.in
 	was using parentheses in a few places where it should have been
 	using curly braces.  Lastly, I changed configure.in to force the
 	makefile to use the libz.a in the zlib subdirectory, otherwise the
 	compiler kept trying to use the libz.a I had in /usr/lib which
 	wasn't compatible.  So anyway, I fixed up configure.in, ran
 	autoconf, and now the whole thing builds "out-of-the-box" on my
 	system.

1999-01-22	Dave Ahn <ahn@vec.wfubmc.edu>

	* BUGFIX (shortcomm.c): thetorp->t_fuse was being set to INTMAX,
