- Eric reported that the client bug that appears when flying near the right
edge is a Paradise-server specific pproblem.  It does not happen in non-
Paradise servers.

I can't reproduce this bug under IRIX 6.5 and Solaris 2.5.1.  It looks like
a Linux specific bug, and I can't say whether it is TT related or a bug
in the kernel/glibc/X/etc. -Dave

- TT should not expire if connecting to a Bronco server.  Should this
carry over to Paradise servers (i.e. no expiration at all)?

- Solaris 2.5.1 binary exhibits the following problem.  Reproducible?

- Do we want local zlib and xpm libs to be always used during compile?

- Do we want the local zlib to be always used, or do we want 

- Self-owned torps should be different color/size from friendly torps.

- Phaser colors don't match 2.4 client.

- Planets < 4 armies should not disappear off galactic.

- Updated sample .tedrc.

- Change some of the default bitmaps for Bronco.

- Trekhopd support.

- Some people have reported sluggishness with TT.  I don't notice this,
but maybe some feedback or testing might help.

- Remove -DAUTHORIZE and other makefile rules and add options to
configure, such as ./configure --enable-RSA.  We want a Makefile that
is more consistent with the GNU standards.

- Cleanup the way XPM images.c is generated.

- Port to Intel/Win32.  This is in the works now; if you want to help,
please contact me.

- Implement SP2.

- Documentation.

- Clean up numerous #ifdef and #if directives.

- GMP 2.x?

- Needed images (not complete):
galactic surface images (STND, THIN, etc)
galactic surface overlay images (STND, THIN, etc)
galactic resource images (Arable, Dilithium, etc)
galactic resource overlay images (Arable, Dilithium, etc)
local map surface overlay images
local resource overlay images
local age images (scout time)
local age overlay images
